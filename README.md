# Scientific Theory in Informatics - IT731A
 Course Presentation What is Informatics? What are the three complementary perspectives on Informatics, and what unifies them? What are the most influential theories within these different perspectives? How can such theoretical stances influence and inform the design of information systems? - And by the way, what is a theory?
 
 Through the exploration of three complementary modules, one for each of the main perspectives on informatics (i.e. computational, cognitive, socio-technical), the course “Scientific Theory in Informatics” assists the students in the construction of an advanced answer to such ambitious and important questions.  Each module consist of theoretical lectures and is integrated by practical seminars. 
 
 The final case study offers our students the opportunity to safely train in transforming theories into inspiring design tools for the pragmatic development of information systems.
