#  Case Study on Credit Card Fraud Detection with KNN, ANN, Decision Tree,Logistic Regression: Comparative Study
This is a comparative analysis on fraud transaction detection on some of the selected machine
learning models of logistic regression, Decision tree classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Artificial
Neural Networks based on credit card transactions collected in 2013. Based on the detailed analysis
and observation results of these models Artificial Neural Networks is performing excellently on
both the balanced and imbalanced data sets. The others perform fine on balanced data sets but have
poor performance on the imbalanced data sets.
As we have observed from the implementation and comparative analysis, Artificial Neural
Network consumes a lot of memory but due to the capabilities of GPU parallel matrix
multiplication of the perceptron’s speed up the network. Artificial Neural Network is not suitable
for low resourced devices (RAM and CPU) whereas the others don't consume a huge memory and
time but their performance is poor. So Artificial Neural Network is recommended for big financial
institutions that want to afford high and expensive resources. 

# Scientific Theory in Informatics - IT731A
 Course Presentation What is Informatics? What are the three complementary perspectives on Informatics, and what unifies them? What are the most influential theories within these different perspectives? How can such theoretical stances influence and inform the design of information systems? - And by the way, what is a theory?
 
 Through the exploration of three complementary modules, one for each of the main perspectives on informatics (i.e. computational, cognitive, socio-technical), the course “Scientific Theory in Informatics” assists the students in the construction of an advanced answer to such ambitious and important questions.  Each module consist of theoretical lectures and is integrated by practical seminars. 
 
 The final case study offers our students the opportunity to safely train in transforming theories into inspiring design tools for the pragmatic development of information systems.
