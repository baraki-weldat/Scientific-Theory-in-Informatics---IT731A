###  Case Study on Credit Card Fraud Detection with KNN, ANN, Decision Tree,Logistic Regression: Comparative Study
This is a comparative analysis on fraud transaction detection on some of the selected machine learning models of logistic regression, Decision tree classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Artificial Neural Networks based on credit card transactions collected in 2013. Based on the detailed analysis and observation results of these models Artificial Neural Networks is performing excellently on both the balanced and imbalanced data sets. 

In this particular case study, the [domino data science projec life cycle](https://www.bastagroup.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Manage_Data_Science_@_Scale.pdf) was used. Ideation, data aquisation and exploration, Model development, Evaluation and Validation, Deployment phases are considered in detail. Additionally, the computational complexity of these machine learning algorithms were explored in depth. Finally, deployment recommendations and computational considerations of a credit card fradualent detection machine learning models were forwarded.

### Overview of the Course
 Course Presentation What is Informatics? What are the three complementary perspectives on Informatics, and what unifies them? What are the most influential theories within these different perspectives? How can such theoretical stances influence and inform the design of information systems? - And by the way, what is a theory?
 
 Through the exploration of three complementary modules, one for each of the main perspectives on informatics (i.e. computational, cognitive, socio-technical), the course “Scientific Theory in Informatics” assists the students in the construction of an advanced answer to such ambitious and important questions.  Each module consist of theoretical lectures and is integrated by practical seminars. 
 
 The final case study offers our students the opportunity to safely train in transforming theories into inspiring design tools for the pragmatic development of information systems.
